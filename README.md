**MTR SALESBOARD**

created by Julian Reid

This is a project for an Internship I had at Med-Tech Resource. This was completed by me(Julian Reid) alone with the project given to me by my mentor Adam Rogers. My internship was three months long. I was able to complete the project in that time. Since then, I have been in touch with Med Tech for updates of any bugs found as well as staff recommendations for improvement. 

The application allows users to create an account, login, add/update/delete sales on their account, view a board of sales that are calculated to show their stats. Admin users can edit user passwords as well as emails. They can also do everything the users can.

The board resets daily and is sortable
